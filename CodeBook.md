# Study Design
The tidy.txt file in this folder contains tidy data of Smartphones Dataset about Human Activity Recognition.
Requirements for data in tidy.txt are desribed in the course project:
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
